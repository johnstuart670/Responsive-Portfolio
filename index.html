			<h2>About Me
				<hr>
			</h2>
<p>
<img class ="imageSelfie" src = "assets/images/Selfie.jpg" alt = "This is me looking as cool as I can muster">Yes, my name is John Stuart, and yes that sounds like the name of the former host of The Daily Show (except that I spell both of my names differently).  I am an aspiring coder in the January-July part-time cohort of the University of Utah Bootcamp, where I am learning Full-Stack coding.  Languages I have been able to dabble in thus far are: HTML, CSS, and a small amount of Javascript. </p>

<p>
By day I work for Silicon Valley Bank as an analyst in the Card Operations department.  My husband and I live in West Jordan Utah with our four dogs: Javi (a rat terrier mix), Boston, Trixie, and Punkin Butter (all three are chihuahua mixes).  I love Mediteranean food üêë, camping üèï, baking üç∞, margaritasüç∏, and crafting ‚úÇÔ∏è!  I also love board games, but I couldn't find an emoji for that.
</p>

<p>
Stay tuned for more as I develop my portfolio.  Feel free to click around and find me on GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow.  The contact page is still under construction, so I'm best to reach on one of those websites.

John
